**prase.tv** is a selfâ€‘hosted, TVâ€‘friendly bookmark manager. It keeps your browser bookmarks in a local SQLite database and provides a simple web UI optimised for the couch. No cloud, no external trackingâ€”everything runs on your machine.

## Stack
- **Backend**: [Go](https://golang.org/) with [Fiber](https://gofiber.io)
- **Frontend**: [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) + TypeScript
- **Browser Extension**: Chrome extension for syncing bookmarks
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Deployment**: Docker / Docker Compose

## Folder structure
- `/server` â€“ Go API server and database schema
- `/web` â€“ Vite web application
- `/extension` â€“ Chrome extension to sync browser bookmarks
- `/nginx` â€“ Nginx config used by Docker

```
praseTV/
â”œâ”€â”€ server      # Go API
â”œâ”€â”€ web         # Frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ extension   # Browser extension
â”œâ”€â”€ nginx       # Reverse proxy config
â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile  # Build all components
```

## Local setup 
1. Clone the repo and build the containers:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AcidBurn/prase.tv.git
   cd prase.tv
   ```

   You can either run 
   ```bash 
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   Or let the run script handle everything for you 
   ```bash 
   chmod +x run_prasetv.sh
   ./run_prasetv.sh
   ```

2. Open `http://prase.tv` in a browser (or localhost if you went without run script). The first run will initialise `prasetv.db` inside the container volume.
3. Install the extension from the `extension/` folder to sync your browser bookmarks.

All data stays local and is served from SQLite. There are no external API calls.

## How it works
- The Dockerfile builds the web UI and Go server into a single image.
- `docker-compose.yml` starts the server and an Nginx proxy on port `80`.
- The Chrome extension sends your bookmarks to `/api/bookmarks/import` and the UI fetches them from `/api/bookmarks`.

## Keyboard controls

The application supports a few keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation. In the
web interface you can move around the bookmark grid using the arrow keys. When
an item is selected:

- **Enter** opens the focused bookmark in a new tab.
- **Delete** removes the bookmark and selects the next one.
- **Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right** switch the focus between bookmarks.
  When no bookmark is focused pressing any arrow key will select the first
  bookmark automatically.

The browser extension also listens for the **Home** key. Pressing it focuses the
open prase.tv tab or opens a new one if none exists.

Navigating the browser tabs? 

Use the browserâ€™s built-in tab navigation:

- `Ctrl + Tab` â†’ Next tab
- `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` â†’ Previous tab
- `Ctrl + W` â†’ Close tab
- `Ctrl + 1` -> You can directly navigate to a tab by giving the tab index (starts from 1)

prase.tv doesnâ€™t override default shortcuts, or tries to mimick their functionality. 

Only `Home` is repurposed (returns to prase.tv inside the extension, and only works outside editable elements, so it doesn't disturb you if you are typing some text).

## Add bookmark 
Once installed, the extension adds an "Add bookmark" option to the right-click (context) menu on any webpage. 

This action uses Chrome's native bookmark API behind the scenesâ€”so anything you bookmark this way automatically syncs with prase.tv.

You can keep using Chrome like you normally would, and prase.tv will stay in sync with your bookmarks seamlessly.

## Bonus: Want to use it as `prase.tv` instead of `localhost`?

You can fake the domain locally using the magic of `/etc/hosts`. On Linux (or macOS), just add this line:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Then add at the bottom:
```
127.0.0.1    prase.tv
```

(Or you can set up dnsmasq)

Now you can open your browser and visit:\
ðŸ‘‰ [**http://prase.tv**](http://prase.tv)

Way fancier than `localhost`, and your couch setup will thank you.\
*Optional: set your browser to auto-launch in kiosk mode for the full TV app experience.*

## Auto-start on boot

If you want prase.tv to run automatically after a reboot, create a systemd service that points to `run_prasetv.sh`. Assuming the repository lives in `/opt/prase.tv`, the service file could look like:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/prasetv.service
[Unit]
Description=Start prase.tv at boot
After=network.target docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=yourusername
Group=yourusername
WorkingDirectory=/opt/prase.tv
ExecStart=/opt/prase.tv/run_prasetv.sh
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now prasetv.service
```
